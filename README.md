## Why this project

I built this page for my 5th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I wanted to build a well designed website where the functionality for online phurchases of wine from the vineyard would be key and where the user and the owner of the site will get the information they need. The project is base on the key elements of the course and the requirements for PP5. The idea of a small family owned vineyard comes from the lonely grapevine in my own backyard that produces large quantities of grapes each year and the winemaking that follows for my small family.

## Strategy

### Features

The website contains three main pages: start/about page, Personal Trainer page, Members page. All main pages are accessible from the navigation menu on the top of the page.

#### EPIC | Landing page

- Responsive navigation menu on the top of the page to be able to navigate to the three main pages. The links to the pages are placed on the right side of the navigation bar, to the left a logo with the project name is placed.
- In the footer, social media links to Facebook and Instagram are placed in the form of icons.

#### EPIC | Personal Trainer Page

#### EPIC | Member Page

## Accessibility

Throughout the process of building the website, I have tried to think of accessibility to make it as user-friendly as possible. I have used the best of my knowledge to:

- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure sufficient color contrasts
- Use images that fit the purpose
- Add hover functionality on menu items and buttons
- Use icons for social media links instead of text
- Maintain the same layout on all main pages

## Technology
