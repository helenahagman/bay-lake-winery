## Why this project

I built this page for my 5th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I wanted to build a well designed website where the functionality for online phurchases of wine from the made-up family vineyard would be key. The project is base on the key elements of the course and the requirements for PP5. The idea of a small family owned vineyard comes from the one and only grapevine in my own backyard that produces large quantities of grapes each year. We do make our own wine and the whole family is involved, from picking the grapes to the finished product.

## Strategy

### Target audiences that the website will focus on

#### Roles

- Persons who are looking to buy wine
- Persons who are interested in winemaking
- Persons who want quality wine from a family farm

#### Demographics

- Persons in the age over 18 years (legal limit in Sweden for alcohol)

#### Psychographics

- Persons who want to:
  - Buy wine
  - Make their own wine
  - Buy wine related products
  - Visit a vineyard

### Link to KANBAN Board with User Stories on Trello

I activated the feature for colorblind that enhances the colors chosen with dots
[Trello KANBAN Board](https://trello.com/b/Vkxp5qMA/kanban-board-pp5-bay-lake-winery).

![Colorblind example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbjnqkn07/image/upload/v1698654799/PP5/colorblind_y5oq7v.jpg)

## Design

### Imagery

The images for the site are a mix of private photos and downloaded images from 
[Pexels Free Images](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/). 
I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for storage.

### Wire Frames

Wireframes were created using Miro and were created for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
I used them as a basis of the pages but using the agile approach the final project 
is not looking the exact same way-

![Wire frames](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbjnqkn07/image/upload/v1698655768/PP5/wireframes_miro_ldtcfa.jpg)

### Features

The website contains three main pages: Start page, Product page and About page.
The Product page is accessible through a 'Shop' button the the Start page and
the About page is accessible from the navigation menu on the top of the page.
When on the About page the link in the navigation menu changes to go to Home.
On the About page there is also a contact form for contact. The shopping cart is
accessible through the navigation menu on the top of all pages as well as the
search function and profile access.

#### EPIC | Landing/start page

- Responsive navigation menu on the top of the page with link and icon to a
  shopping cart, access to the profile with log in/log out and register
  possibility. There is also a search function and a link to an About page.
- The links are placed on the right side of the navigation bar, to the left the
  project name is placed and links to the start page.

#### EPIC | Product page

- Short descriptive information along with an image, price and link to make it
  possible to add products to the shopping cart.

#### EPIC | About Page

- A short text about the family bussiness along with a contact form.

## Accessibility

Throughout the process of building the website, I have tried to think of accessibility to make it as user-friendly as possible. I have used the best of my knowledge to:

- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure sufficient color contrasts
- Use images that fit the purpose
- Add hover functionality on menu items and buttons
- Use icons where possible 
  ![Icons](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbjnqkn07/image/upload/v1698656006/PP5/icons_ncjj1d.jpg)
- Maintain the same layout on all pages

## SEO
- I used WordTracker to find meta keywords and I used the result as help. 
![Wordtracker](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbjnqkn07/image/upload/v1698656524/PP5/wordtracker_i8ndad.jpg)

# Topics & possible keywords
- Wineyard - wine lovers, wine, wine shop, organic, grapewine
- Wine products - wine, bottles, wine-making kit
- Family farm - high quality, winemaking, wine tours, wine tasting

## Marketing Strategy
- I think that the best marketing strategy for this project would be to be active on social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.
- Set up a google ads account with google analytics to really get the knowledge of what customers want and search for.
- Possibly ads in local newspapers
- It would be very important for regular and high quality posts on social media and work more on the meta tags for the site to drive trafic even more.

### Deployment
For deployment I followed the steps in the walkthrough.

#### Deployment to heroku

1. Account settings
2. Copy the API key
3. Enter the command: heroku_config , and enter the API key
4. Enter heroku username
5. Enter the API key

#### Credits

- Throughout the project I have worked with the walk-through project
  'Building an E-Commerce Platform' for the Code Institute. The base of the set
  up is used from the same.
