## Why this project

I built this page for my 5th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I wanted to build a well designed website where the functionality for online phurchases of wine from the vineyard would be key and where the user and the owner of the site will get the information they need. The project is base on the key elements of the course and the requirements for PP5. The idea of a small family owned vineyard comes from the lonely grapevine in my own backyard that produces large quantities of grapes each year and the winemaking that follows for my small family.

## Strategy

### Target audiences that the website will focus on

#### Roles

- Persons who are looking to buy wine
- Persons who are interested in winemaking

#### Demographics

- Persons in the age over 18 years

#### Psychographics

- Persons who want to:
  - Buy wine
  - Make their own wine
  - Buy wine related products
  - Visit a vineyard

## Accessibility

Throughout the process of building the website, I have tried to think of accessibility to make it as user-friendly as possible. I have used the best of my knowledge to:

- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure sufficient color contrasts
- Use images that fit the purpose
- Add hover functionality on menu items and buttons
- Use icons for social media links instead of text
- Maintain the same layout on all main pages
